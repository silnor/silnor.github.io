### Hi, I’m Silnor! 👋

I’m a student interested in web development and technology. *I enjoy learning how websites are built, exploring how design and structure work together, and experimenting with ideas through personal projects.*

###  About Me

**I like creating simple, organized websites and learning how things work behind the scenes.** I’m focused on building a strong foundation, improving over time, and understanding how real-world websites are designed and maintained.

*This site is a place where I share what I’m working on and track my progress as I learn and grow.*
