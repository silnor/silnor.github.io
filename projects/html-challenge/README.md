### HTML Challenge - *Does a limit on your tools actually unlock your best ideas?*
**Project Time:** 1/16/26 -<br>**Status:** Pre-production<br>~~Play~~

**The idea that creativity can thrive under limitation has always existed.** Early humans could not build modern supercomputers, of course. They were constrained by the tools available to them, yet those limits led to foundational inventions like fire and the wheel.

**So what happens if we apply that same mindset to the modern day? What if we** **_intentionally_** **take limitations and use them as a framework for creative thinking?**

*“But Silnor, I bet someone has already done that!”* Yeah, probably. But I am talking about a full-blown game, not just a basic choose-your-own-adventure where the choices are limited by the format. I mean real visuals within an ASCII-themed world, custom images, and making use of every part of available HTML. There would be full lore and everything. I know, it sounds crazy.

That said, this would be a terrible first project to jump into at full scale, so I want to start with a simple, limited demo to test the waters. If it is bad, it will be fixed. If mistakes are made, they will be fixed. This is not going to be a lazy plot full of holes or a buggy mess thrown together for a quick buck. I cannot, and will not, do it for money. I am doing it for the love of the game.

I imagine it being similar to the original text-only version of The Oregon Trail, but with some animations. I have always had an interest in text-based games, especially purely text-driven ones, because they let me create the visuals myself instead of being boxed in by what developers think a game should look like. Some games absolutely need strict visual rules, and that makes sense. But for my projects, I want creative freedom.

More than anything, I want to bring creative thinking into my own process. With all the AI tools available now, it feels like you rarely make something for yourself. You give minimal instructions and let something else do the work. This project is about pushing against that and creating something personal for the sake of myself and others to get inspired and create something man-made.
